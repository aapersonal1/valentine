                <p> Dear Justin,</p>
                <p>
                    I'm so happy we get to spend this Valentine's Day "together", even though we are physically 
                    apart. I hope you enjoyed this little website I put together. I had to scour through a lot of my old 
                    projects because I suprisingly forgot a lot of stuff (also thanks Stack Overflow for helping me with the random
                    specific stuff!). I made it password protected so no one can access this personal note, and you can come 
                    back to it again and again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, it's been a tumultous couple of months, huh? 
                    From the anctipitory week before you shipped off, to the first month of hellish basic training, 
                    to the joy of holiday break leave and getting ENGAGED, followed by going back to basic training for 
                    another hellish month. I'll start by talking about how the experience impacted me.
                    First, being away from you really tore me apart. There were days that I missed you so much that it physically 
                    hurt in my chest. I would fall asleep thinking of you, wishing you were beside me, and I would wake up
                    and go about my day with you on my mind. I held on to things that reminded me of you, like my engagement
                    ring that I love so dearly, my crocodile, looking at the stars every night, and watching videos of you 
                    just to hear your beautiful voice again. I never thought otherwise even when you were here, but these 
                    past few months really reaffirmed that I truly need you in my life. I care about your so safety so deeply that
                    just the thought of something harming you makes me tear up. Justin, you always protect me and have my back
                    no matter the situation. I want to do the same for you. I want you to feel protected and safe like that when I'm around. 
                    I want you to feel that even though the whole world seems against you or isolates you, I always have your back 
                    and will be there to remind you that you could strip yourself down to the core and I'd still love you. I never once 
                    thought of you as weak, even though you keep trying to convince me that you are. I never thought that you
                    were "different" or "weird" or anything like that. You've always been someone I've admired, looked up to, 
                    and sought approval from since day 1. I admire your thirst for knowledge and how I can ask you about nearly anything. I even needed 
                    your help when I was stuck in my cybersecurity class, because I knew you'd know concepts I didn't understand. 
                    I admire your way of speaking/writing and the fact that you always know exactly what to say to make me feel better or rationalize my
                    emotions. I run to you because I know that you're my safety and my anchor. I missed your soothing voice and your 
                    ability to quiet my mind no matter how loud it is. I didn't realize the impact you had on my stability until 
                    I realized how difficult this semester and last has been without you. I really love that you can be soft and emotional 
                    because it makes you more human and easy to love. I was terrified that the army would take that away from you because that's my favorite thing
                    about you. You are intelligent, driven, and capable, but still
                    choose to be gentle and kind with me. I'm so happy I chose you.

                </p>
                <p>But I know that I wasn't the one who had to carry most of the burden. It was you. You were pushed past
                    your physical and mental limit, and you had everything stripped away from you. I know you deeply missed me and your family. These past few months demanded 
                    everything from you, of course it was never going to be easy. But you still overcame it and endured. You overcame 
                    things people couldn't even fathom going through. I am just so incredibly proud of you for completing it! You never quit, 
                    you never injured yourself, you passed all the physical requirements, you stood up
                    for yourself and others when people were being assholes, you *dealt* with that one person who needed to be dealth with,
                    and most of all, you get to have a comfy AIT all because you proved you're smarter than pretty much everyone there.  
                    You demonstrated so much strength, and not many people can do what you did! No one can 
                    ever doubt you again, or call you weak. You truly withstood the greatest test of your own strength. And you really did a fine job! 
                    I wish I could give you a huge hug and a big kiss, and I will as soon as I see you! It feels so good to have you back 
                    and hear your voice and your laughter again. You deserve a good, comfortable, and safe life. You deserve to 
                    feel proud of yourself for accomplishing such a feat. And I just know you'll feel the benefit of it pretty soon. I just 
                    know that this investment will pay off. 
                </p>

                <p>I'm so happy to be engaged with you. It brings me so much joy and comfort to know that you're my fiancé. I couldn't imagine a man
                    more perfect than you! I think it's so beautiful that we were able to choose each other throughout all this chaos.
                    The thought of you was my solace, and it made me realize that all the emotions, distance, and patience were worth it for you. 
                    I would still do it for you again a thousand times over. I know you felt the same way about me, just by reading your letters and 
                    from the way you lovingly spoke to me on our short calls. I adore you so much, Justin. You are my best friend and the greatest love of my life.
                    I can't wait to marry you. I can't wait to move in, kiss you good night and good morning everday, cook for you, and 
                    be there for you when things are hard. You're so handsome and sexy, I can't believe I have you all to myself. 
                    You are my cutest baby bunny, and I'd truly do anything for you. I love you so so so so much Justin bear, my
                    forever Valentine!
                </p>
